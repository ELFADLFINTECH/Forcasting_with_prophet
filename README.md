# Forcasting_with_prophet


## SaltPay

The aim is to: 
* Predict the sales per merchant per day for the next 3 months!

Guidance:
* Simply run the following code, where x represent a merchant_id:
       
```
 prophet_model(x)
```

Notes:
*  there wil be a list of merchant_id numbers to choose from.
* I used prophet forcasting model for this project.
* the code is part of supsequent defintions that are linked togather, So it is recommended to run the important cells to get the desired outputs.
